  <h1>Constructor Function</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>In JavaScript, a constructor function is used to create objects.</li>
    <li>
      It is considered good practice to capitalize the first letter of your
      constructor function.
    </li>
    <li>
      To create an object from a constructor function, we use the new keyword.
    </li>
    <li>
      In JavaScript, when this keyword is used in a constructor function, this
      refers to the object when the object is generated.
    </li>
    <li>
      In JavaScript, you can create multiple objects from a constructor
      function.
    </li>
    <li>You can also create a constructor function with parameters.</li>
    <li>
      <h3>Constructor Function vs Object Literal</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Object Literal is generally used to create a single object. The
          constructor function is useful if you want to create multiple objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each object created from the constructor function is unique. You can
          have the same properties as the constructor function or add a new
          property to one particular object.
        </li>
        <li>
          if an object is created with an object literal, and if a variable is
          defined with that object value, any changes in variable value will
          change the original object.
        </li>
        <li>
          When an object is created with an object literal, any object variable
          derived from that object will act as a clone of the original object.
          Hence, any change you make in one object will also reflect in the
          other object.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Adding Properties and Methods in an Object</h3></li>
    <li>
      <h3>JavaScript Object Prototype</h3>
      <p>
        You can also add properties and methods to a constructor function using
        a prototype.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
